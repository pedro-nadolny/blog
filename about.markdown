The main goal of this page is to be a place where I can share some of my adventures, challenges, and experiences I have through my software development life. It is meant to be more of a personal thing than a tool that I use to spread my word and name around. That's was one of the reasons I've decided not to use some paid service to do so, don't need all the features those have, just need something I can grab, write and publish. As well, I just preferred something where I could put a little bit of my flavour to it.

Will be willing to receive some feedback, you can reach me through my [contact page](/contact), or the icons I've put in the left menu bar. Also, if you have any questions or anything I can help you with, feel free to reach me. Enjoy the content!
