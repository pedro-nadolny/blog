The main goal of this page is to be a place where I can share some of my adventures, challenges, and experiences I have thought my software development life. It is meant to be more of a personal thing than some tool I use to spread my word, or my name around. That's was one of the reasons I've decided not to use medium, don't need all the features that have, just need something I can grab, write and publish. Also, I just preferred something where I could put a little bit of my flavour to it, design wise (not that it's good, it is for me at least). 

On my first blog post, I detail the process of putting this page into air, if you are interested in that, check it out. Will be willing to receive some feedback, you can reach me through my [contact page](/contact), or the icons I've put in the left menu bar. Also, if you have any questions or anything I can help you with, feel free to reach me. 

Well, talking a little bit about me. I'm a Brazilian developer with more experience in the iOS development stack. Natural from and currently based in the beloved city of Curitiba. Recently been going to different stacks to get a taste of then, pretty interesed in anything related to tecnology and software development. Hmm, that's enought right? Hope you enjoy my content.
